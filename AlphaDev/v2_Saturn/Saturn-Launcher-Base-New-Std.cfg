	description = This is the standard-size free-standing base for the Saturn Mobile Launcher. The base attaches to a free node in the center of a rocket's lower or core stage using the upper size 5 node in the flame hole. One of the two flame hole insert components attaches to the lower size 5 node. The tower base section attaches to the third size 5 node on the other end of the launcher base.  Includes a built-in decoupler and an elevator for crew access from the ground to the top deck. For best results, put the front legs so that they are inside the white part of the big circle on the VAB floor. No launch clamps are necessary. Includes a manually-activated generator for electric charge.
