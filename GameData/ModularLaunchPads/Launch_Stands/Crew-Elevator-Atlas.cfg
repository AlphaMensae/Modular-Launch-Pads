	title = Mercury-Atlas Crew Elevator
	manufacturer = Alphadyne Construction Group
	description = A crew access elevator for small manned spacecraft, inspired by the emergency egress and umbilical tower used for Mercury-Atlas and designed for the Tier 1 launch pad and the Atlas Launch Stand, but can be used with some other launch bases and stands.  The elevator tower is a fixed type, with 8 colors available. The stopping height of the elevator car is adjusted with a deploy limit slider. Use with the Mercury-Atlas Elevator Crew Walkway, which attaches to one of the front nodes, and flips up to retract. The separate Mercury Umbilical Mast attaches to a node on the front platform of the tower.
