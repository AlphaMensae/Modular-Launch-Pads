	description = This is the Shutte tower lightning mast that was first used for the AS-210 Saturn IB launch (ASTP Apollo), also mounted on the hammerhead crane. It was later installed on the LC-39B FSS for use with the Space Shuttle. It attaches to the top node on the crane. Alternate mount types are available for use with the space shuttle FSS and general towers.
