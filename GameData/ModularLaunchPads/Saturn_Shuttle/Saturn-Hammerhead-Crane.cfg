	description = A distinctive feature of the Saturn tower was this hammerhead crane that sat on the very top.  This crane has no hoist capability, but it can be rotated 90 degrees to the launch position via an animation; for launches, the crane was rotated 90 degree in the clockwise direction. A gray variant is also available. The lightning mast on top can be switched between the original Saturn tower mast or the new Shuttle mast, which was first used for the ASTP Saturn IB launch, or can be turned off.
