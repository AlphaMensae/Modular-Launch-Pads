	description = The Rotating Service Structure (RSS) for the Shuttle Launcher Base, used to access and change out the orbiter's payload bay IRL; this version can not be used for that. It attaches to a large node located on the FSS Tower's base section. The RSS can be closed and rolled out via an animation...a slow animation. This thing is huge after all.
