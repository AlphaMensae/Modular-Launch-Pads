These are the free-standing versions of the Saturn and Shuttle Launch Bases. They have a mass of 2000t to keep them on the ground
when a powerful rocket's engines are started.  Driving a vehicle into physics range sometimes can cause a massive explosion to happen,
as KSP can be glitchy with large craft sitting on the pad or ground without a launch clamp holding them.

To use these versions, copy the two .mu files and the two .cfg files in the Extras/Saturn-Shuttle_Freestanding_Base 
into the ModularLaunchPads/Saturn_Shuttle folder.
