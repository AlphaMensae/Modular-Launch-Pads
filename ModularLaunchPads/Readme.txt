INSTALLATION

Modular Launch Pads v2.1 is only for KSP versions 1.8.1 and higher, older KSP versions are no longer supported.

Delete any existing Modular Launch Pads folder. Always do this when updating, as file names can change, and simply copying a new version over the older one can cause problems.

In the download .zip file, there is a GameData folder. Copy the ModularLaunchPads folder from there into your KSP GameData folder. DO NOT put the GameData folder from the .zip into your KSP GameData folder, there can be only one GameData.

If you already have the latest versions of the dependencies, then you do not need to copy them over. Otherwise copy over the ones you need from the .zip into your KSP GameData folder.

B9PartSwitch is required, and must be present in your KSP GameData.

CommunityCategoryKit is required, as the parts are hidden from the stock categories by default, and the custom CCK category is needed to find them. The included stock custom category (located in the Advanced mode of the part picker) can also be used, and includes subcategories.

Animated Decouplers is optional, but strongly recommended as it allows the the animations for the various hold-downs, umbilicals, swing arms and fallback towers to be staged.

Animated Attachment is optional, but makes rotating the launch rails much easier. Warning: Animated Attachment adds itself to all animated parts, gimballing engines, control surfaces and launch clamps. I have a patch that removes it from all my parts except the launch rails and Saturn Hammerhead Crane, but other mod parts and the stock parts will still have it. I am not responsible for what Animated Attachment does to other parts, only my own.

Craft files go into your KSP/saves/xxxx/Ships/VAB.

The Extras Folder has the older freestanding versions of the Saturn and Shuttle Launch Bases. Copy the .cfg and .mu files into the ModularLaunchPads/Saturn_Shuttle folder to use them.
