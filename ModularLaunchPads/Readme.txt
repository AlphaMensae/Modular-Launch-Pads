INSTALLATION

New Install:

1>  Copy the contents of the GameData folder in the download .zip (NOT the GameData folder) into your KSP GameData folder.

    You will be copying ModularLaunchPads, Animated Decouplers, B9PartSwitch and CommunityCategoryKit into your KSP/GameData folder.

    If you already have any of the dependencies, then you do not need to copy them over.

    Craft files go into your saves/xxxx/Ships/VAB

    Subassemblies go into your saves/xxxx/Subassemblies folder.

2>  If using KSP version 1.3.1, then use the versions of Animated Decouplers, B9PartSwitch and Community Category Kit
    located in the KSP_1_3_1-Dependencies.


Updating from v1:

     It's best to delete the old version of Modular Launch Pads and do a fresh install, but if you have any craft files that you want to keep first, then the v2.0
     parts can co-exist with v1. Copy over the v2.0 partsinto the existing ModularLaunchPads folder.

     Delete the old Category, Patches and Tree folders in v1, and copy over the new versions of those folders
