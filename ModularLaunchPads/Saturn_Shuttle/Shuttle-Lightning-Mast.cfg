	description = This is the Shuttle FSS tower lightning mast that was first used for the AS-210 Saturn IB launch (ASTP Apollo), mounted on the hammerhead crane. The crane with the mast was also used for a time with the Space Shuttle's FSS tower, then the crane was removed and the mast mounted directly on the top of the tower. This mast has switchable mount styles: FSS Tower, Hammerhead Crane and a General Tower mount. It attaches to the top node on a tower top section or on the top of the Hammerhead Crane.
