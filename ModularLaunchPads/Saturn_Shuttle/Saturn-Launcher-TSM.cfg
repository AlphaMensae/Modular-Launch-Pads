	description = Three of these tail service masts were located on the launcher base, connected to the lower part of the S-IC stage of the Saturn V, and were retracted at liftoff. These have to be placed separately, and attach to nodes right outside the flame hole, two on one side, and one on the other side. Rotate them 5 degrees to have them properly aligned with the S-IC.
