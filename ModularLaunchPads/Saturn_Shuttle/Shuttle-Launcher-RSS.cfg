	description = The Rotating Service Structure (RSS) for the Shuttle Launcher Base, used to access and change out the orbiter's payload bay IRL; this version can not be used for that. It attaches to a large node located on the top of the RSS Hinge's central pole. The RSS support legs can be switched between the default height for the stock tier 3 pad and a shorter height for the larger LC-39 pad in Tundra's Space Center/KSC Extended. The RSS can be closed and rolled out via an animation...a slow animation, as this thing is huge after all!
