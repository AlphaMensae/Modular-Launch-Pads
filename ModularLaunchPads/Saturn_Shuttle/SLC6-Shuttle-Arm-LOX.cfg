	description = The "beanie cap" Liquid Oxygen Vent Arm for the SLC-6 shuttle tower. Has 3 color variants; the IRL arm was still mostly gray with some red beams at the rear. The arm is attached to a node on the front of top section, not on the square-sided mast base, with the cap centered over the top of the shuttle's External Tank and almost touching the tank. The arm was retracted at around the T-2 minute point in the countdown.
