	description = A separate crew access floor for the crew access tower section of the Shuttle Launcher's FSS tower, used to provide access from the tower elevator to the crew access arm when a command pod's hatch does not align with the bottom of the crew access section. Attach the floor to the node in the elevator shaft of the crew access section, and adjust its height with the offset gizmo. The floor has three configurations: Shuttle Arm access, Rodan Arm access and Launch Platform access. The floor also has two color options, default gray and alternate black&white.
