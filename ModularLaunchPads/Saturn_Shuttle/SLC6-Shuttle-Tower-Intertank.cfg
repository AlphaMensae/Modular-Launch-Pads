	description = The Intertank Structure for the SLC-6 shuttle tower. It attaches to one of the nodes on the side of the tower opposite the crew arm. The main structure can be adjusted sideways with the deploy limit slider. The one thing that was mounted on this structure was the Hydrogen Vent Arm, which attaches to the node at the end of the main structure.
