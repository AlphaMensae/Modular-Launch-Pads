	description = Two of these tail service masts are mounted on the Shuttle Launcher Base, one on each side of the orbiter's engine section. Use mirror symmetry to orient them properly so the umbilicals face towards the shuttle. The umbilicals have an animated retraction. The sparkers have to be started manually with an action group.
