	description = Gaseous Hydrogen Vent Arm for the Shuttle Launcher's FSS Tower. This arm was used to vent hydrogen gas boiling up into the intertank area, and was dropped at liftoff. The arm attaches to the intertank access structure, on the node at the top, with the umbilical touching the External Tank's intertank at about the middle.
