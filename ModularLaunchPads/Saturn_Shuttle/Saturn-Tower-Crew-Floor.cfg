	description = A separate crew access floor for the crew access tower section of the Saturn tower, used to provide access from the tower elevator to the crew access arm when a command pod's hatch does not align with the bottom of the crew access section. Attach the floor to the node in the elevator shaft of the crew access section, and adjust its height with the offset gizmo. The floor has two configurations: Saturn Crew Arm access from the back with the walkway or Milkstool access from the front. The floor also has two color options, default red and alternate gray.
