// This file is always empty in CCK but third-party mods are allowed (and
// encouraged) to extend it with own custom filters. There will be a
// filter entry created in the editor for every Item record in this file if
// it has at least one matching part.
//
// In order to create a custom filter create a ModuleManager patch file and
// put it anywhere in your mod's folder structure:
//
// @CCKExtraFilterConfig
// {
//	Item
//	{
//		name = Cool Mod Things
//		tag = cck-cool-mod
//		normalIcon = CoolMod/Textures/FilterIcon
//		usedByMod = Cool Mod
//	}
// }
// NOTE. If you want a special icon to be displayed when the filter is active
// use `selectedIcon` field to define one.
//
// See more info here: https://github.com/BobPalmer/CommunityCategoryKit/wiki
//
// NOTE. Avoid creating a brand new filter only because you feel you need
// one. You may improve players experience by re-using filters used by the
// other mods. To figure out if there are right candidates try the following:
// 1. Check CCK common filters (common-filters.cfg).
// 2. Try searching KSP add-ons forum for keyword "CCK" or
//    "CommunityCategoryKit". When mod uses CCK it's usually stated in the
//    description.
// 3. Ask community by posting a question on the CCK forum.
// 4. Find another mod (other than yours) which may benefit of the new
//    filter, and suggest a new common filter on the CCK forum!
//
// Once you've found the right mod just use its tag and some icon texture
// (communicate with the author if they use own icon). CCK will automatically
// de-dupe filters so what there will be only one filter created with all the
// matching parts.

CCKExtraFilterConfig
{
	// Add Item entires for custom filters via ModuleManager.
}
