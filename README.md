# Modular-Launch-Pads Version 2 Dev Builds

These are the new Saturn and Shuttle pad parts for the upcoming v2 of Modular Launch Pads.

Requires Animated Decouplers and B9 Part Switch for either KSP v1.3.1 or 1.4.5, both plugins are in the latest current release of Modular Launch Pads.

The AlphaDev folder goes into the KSP Gamedata folder, not Modular Launch Pads; it is a standalone dev build of the v2 Saturn and Shuttle pad parts.

Note: Currently the hold-down arms for the Saturn Mobile Launcher Base are not in the AlphaDev v2 build, they are still from v1.3.7 of Modular Launch Pads, and the full mod is needed for those and the Soyuz/Russian parts.
