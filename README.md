# Modular-Launch-Pads Version 2 Dev Builds

Requires Animated Decouplers and B9 Part Switch for either KSP v1.3.1 or 1.4.5, both plugins are in the latest current release of Modular Launch Pads.

The AlphaDev folder goes into the KSP Gamedata folder, not Modular Launch Pads; it is a standalone dev build of the v2 Saturn and Shuttle pad parts.
