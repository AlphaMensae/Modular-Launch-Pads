# Modular Launch Pads Current Release: 2.9.0

*	Added alternate version of the Atlas Launch Stand that has no monolithic frame, and with the center clamps and side umbilicals converted into separate sections, adjustable in tandem.
*	Fixed colliders for the support leg option on the General Launch Base Medium (#4) so the base doesn't sit up above the launch pad static.
